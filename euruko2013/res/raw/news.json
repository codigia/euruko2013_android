		"body" : "<p>We are very excited to announce that Call for Presentations for EuRuKo 2013 <a href='http://cfp.euruko2013.org/proposals'>is now open</a> and you can send your proposals until <strong>April 23rd</strong>! We have put a lot of effort in order to create a selection process that will encourage submissions by everyone irrespective of publicity, gender, race, domain, etc, guarantee a high quality conference and at the same time be fun for all participants. The process has been refined with feedback from the community and all the details can be found <a href='http://cfp.euruko2013.org/about'>here</a>.</p>

<p>So mark the dates and get engaged:</p>

<ul>
<li>Submit your proposal! We are pretty sure that almost everyone has something interesting to share!</li>

<li>Help refine the proposals: comment, suggest, criticise and show your love :)</li>

<li>Spread the news to the proper channels: your local ruby user groups, your blog, your circles!</li>
</ul>

<p>&#8230;and one last thing: you know how hard it is to find a ticket for EuRuKo usually, right? They tend to sell out in seconds. Well, this year, we are reserving a priority line for active participants in the CfP process along some other goodies that may come later.</p>

<p>So, what are you waiting for? <a href='http://cfp.euruko2013.org'>Join the party</a>!</p>",
